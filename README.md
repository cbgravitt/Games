# Games
Some simple games I've made. Most are in-progress.

#BlackJack
To run: python blackjack.py
Currently the only option is to play the house without betting.
The house follows casino rules: it always hits on 16 or below, and stands 17 or above.
Betting feature coming soon!

#Minesweeper
In Progress!
